        My journey in life has taught me diverse lessons such that it is until i laydown my sword i will stop
        learning
        That is my story about going back to learnig software development,<br> this is what i have rejected in time
        past
        that i can not do simply because i was thinking it is time consuming, it wont let me have time of myself.
        Alas it wasnt so, because i later realize that even the simplest of Job can also be tiring provided one is
        not
        committed to it.
        therefore, i cant afford to chicken out of what i know that it can build name for me, impact younger
        generation
        and so on.
